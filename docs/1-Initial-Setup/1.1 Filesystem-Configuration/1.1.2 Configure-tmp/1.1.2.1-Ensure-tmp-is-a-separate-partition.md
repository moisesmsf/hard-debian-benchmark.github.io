##Audit
Run the following command and verify the output shows that /tmp is mounted. Particular requirements pertaining to mount options are covered in ensuing sections.
```bash linenums="1"
# findmnt --kernel /tmp
TARGET SOURCE FSTYPE OPTIONS
/tmp tmpfs tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,inode6
```
Ensure that systemd will mount the /tmp partition at boot time
```bash linenums="1"
# systemctl is-enabled tmp.mount
enabled
```
Note that by default systemd will output generated if there is an entry in /etc/fstab for /tmp. This just means systemd will use the entry in /etc/fstab instead of it's default unit file configuration for /tmp.

##Remediation
First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time.
``` bash linenums="1"
# systemctl unmask tmp.mount
```
For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab or tmp.mount.
Example of /etc/fstab configured tmpfs file system with specific mount options:
```bash
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0
```
Example of tmp.mount configured tmpfs file system with specific mount options:
```bash linenums="1"
