## Audit
Run the following command and verify output shows /var/log is mounted:
```bash
# findmnt --kernel /var/log
TARGET	SOURCE	FSTYPE 	OPTIONS
/var/log 	/dev/sdb 	ext4	rw,relatime,seclabel,data=ordered
```

## Remediation
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/log.

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.
