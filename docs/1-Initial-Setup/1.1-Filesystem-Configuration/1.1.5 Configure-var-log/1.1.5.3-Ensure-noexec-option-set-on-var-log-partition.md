## Audit
Verify that the noexec option is set for the /var/log mount.

Run the following command to verify that the noexec mount option is set.

Example:
```bash
# findmnt --kernel /var/log
/var/log	/dev/sdb ext4	rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel
```

IF output is produced, ensure it includes the noexec option

## Remediation
IF the /var/log partition exists, edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options) for the /var/log partition.

Example:
```bash
<device> /var/log	<fstype>	defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime	0 0
```

Run the following command to remount /var/log with the configured options:
```bash
# mount -o remount /var/log
```
