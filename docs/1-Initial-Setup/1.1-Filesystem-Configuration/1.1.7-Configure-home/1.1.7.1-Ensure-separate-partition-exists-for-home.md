## Audit
Run the following command and verify output shows /home is mounted:
```bash
# findmnt --kernel /home
TARGET SOURCE FSTYPE OPTIONS
/home /dev/sdb ext4 rw,relatime,seclabel
```

## Remediation
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /home.

For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.
