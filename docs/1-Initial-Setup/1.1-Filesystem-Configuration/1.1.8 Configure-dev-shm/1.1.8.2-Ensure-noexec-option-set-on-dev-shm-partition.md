## Audit
Verify that the noexec option is set for the /dev/shm mount.

Run the following command to verify that the noexec mount option is set.

Example:
```bash
# findmnt --kernel /dev/shm | grep noexec
/dev/shm tmpfs tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,seclabel
```

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options) for the /dev/shm partition.

Example:
```bash
<device> /dev/shm <fstype> defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0
```

Run the following command to remount /dev/shm with the configured options:
```bash
# mount -o remount /dev/shm
```
NOTE It is recommended to use tmpfs as the device/filesystem type as /dev/shm is used as shared memory space by applications.
