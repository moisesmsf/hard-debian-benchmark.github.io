## Audit
Verify that the nodev option is set for the /dev/shm mount.

Run the following command to verify that the nodev mount option is set.

Example:
```bash
# findmnt --kernel /dev/shm | grep nodev
```

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options) for the /dev/shm partition. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.

Run the following command to remount /dev/shm using the updated options from /etc/fstab:
```bash
# mount -o remount /dev/shm
```
