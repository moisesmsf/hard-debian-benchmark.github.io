## Audit
As a preference autofs should not be installed unless other packages depend on it.

Run the following command to verify autofs is not installed:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled autofs
Failed to get unit file state for autofs.service: No such file or directory
```

Run the following command to verify autofs is not enabled if installed:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled autofs
disabled
```

Verify result is not "enabled"

## Remediation
If there are no other packages that depends on autofs, remove the package with:
```bash
# apt purge autofs
```

OR if there are dependencies on the autofs package:
Run the following commands to mask autofs:
```bash
# systemctl stop autofs
# systemctl mask autofs
```
