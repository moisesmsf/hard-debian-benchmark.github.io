## Audit
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
```bash
# grep "^set superusers" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
set superusers="<username>"
# grep "^password" /boot/grub/grub.cfg
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>
```

## Remediation
Create an encrypted password with grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2:
```bash
# grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2
Enter password: <password>
Reenter password: <password>
PBKDF2 hash of your password is <encrypted-password>
```

Add the following into a custom /etc/grub.d configuration file:
```bash
cat <<EOF
set superusers="<username>"
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>
EOF
```

The superuser/user information and password should not be contained in the /etc/grub.d/00_header file as this file could be overwritten in a package update.

If there is a requirement to be able to boot/reboot without entering the password, edit /etc/grub.d/10_linux and add --unrestricted to the line CLASS=

Example:
```bash
CLASS="--class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --unrestricted"
```

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:
```bash
# update-grub
```

Default Value:

This recommendation is designed around the grub bootloader, if LILO or another bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings.

Replace /boot/grub/grub.cfg with the appropriate grub configuration file for your environment.
