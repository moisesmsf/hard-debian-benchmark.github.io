title: 1.5.4 Ensure core dumps are restricted
description: A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user.

## Audit
Run the following commands and verify output matches:
```bash
# grep -Es '^(\*|\s).*hard.*core.*(\s+#.*)?$' /etc/security/limits.conf /etc/security/limits.d/*
* hard core 0

# sysctl fs.suid_dumpable
fs.suid_dumpable = 0

# grep "fs.suid_dumpable" /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*
fs.suid_dumpable = 0
```

Run the following command to check if systemd-coredump is installed:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled coredump.service
```

If enabled, masked, or disabled is returned systemd-coredump is installed

## Remediation
Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf or a /etc/security/limits.d/* file:
```bash
* hard core 0
```

Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file:
```bash
fs.suid_dumpable = 0
```

Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:
```bash
# sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0
```

IF systemd-coredump is installed:

edit /etc/systemd/coredump.conf and add/modify the following lines:
```bash
Storage=none
ProcessSizeMax=0
```

Run the command:
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
```
