This information can be useful to developers who are developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8) supports the following options, they display operating system information = \m - machine architecture \r - operating system release \s - operating system name \v - operating system version

## Audit
Run the following command and verify no results are returned:
```bash
# grep -Eis "(\\\v|\\\r|\\\m|\\\s|$(grep '^ID=' /etc/os-release | cut -d= -f2 | sed -e 's/"//g'))" /etc/motd
```
