title: 1.8.5 Ensure GDM screen locks cannot be overridden
description: GNOME Desktop Manager can make the screen lock automatically whenever the user is idle for some amount of time. By using the lockdown mode in dconf, you can prevent users from changing specific settings. To lock down a dconf key or subpath, create a locks subdirectory in the keyfile directory. The files inside this directory contain a list of keys or subpaths to lock. Just as with the keyfiles, you may add any number of files to this directory.

## Audit
Run the following script to verify that the screen lock can not be overridden:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash
{
 # Check if GNOME Desktop Manager is installed. If package isn't installed, recommendation is Not Applicable\n
 # determine system's package manager
 l_pkgoutput=""
 if command -v dpkg-query > /dev/null 2>&1; then
 l_pq="dpkg-query -W"
 elif command -v rpm > /dev/null 2>&1; then
 l_pq="rpm -q"
 fi
 # Check if GDM is installed
 l_pcl="gdm gdm3" # Space seporated list of packages to check
 for l_pn in $l_pcl; do
 $l_pq "$l_pn" > /dev/null 2>&1 && l_pkgoutput="$l_pkgoutput\n - Package: \"$l_pn\" exists on the system\n - checking configuration"
 done
 # Check configuration (If applicable)
 if [ -n "$l_pkgoutput" ]; then
 l_output="" l_output2=""
 # Look for idle-delay to determine profile in use, needed for remaining tests
 l_kfd="/etc/dconf/db/$(grep -Psril '^\h*idledelay\h*=\h*uint32\h+\d+\b' /etc/dconf/db/*/ | awk -F'/' '{split($(NF1),a,".");print a[1]}').d" #set directory of key file to be locked
 l_kfd2="/etc/dconf/db/$(grep -Psril '^\h*lockdelay\h*=\h*uint32\h+\d+\b' /etc/dconf/db/*/ | awk -F'/' '{split($(NF1),a,".");print a[1]}').d" #set directory of key file to be locked
 if [ -d "$l_kfd" ]; then # If key file directory doesn't exist, options can't be locked

 l_output="$l_output\n - \"idle-delay\" is locked in \"$(grep - Pril '\/org\/gnome\/desktop\/session\/idle-delay\b' "$l_kfd")\""
 else
 l_output2="$l_output2\n - \"idle-delay\" is not locked"

 l_output2="$l_output2\n - \"idle-delay\" is not set so it can not be locked"
 fi
 if [ -d "$l_kfd2" ]; then # If key file directory doesn't exist, options can't be locked

 fi
 else
 l_output="$l_output\n - GNOME Desktop Manager package is not installed on the system\n - Recommendation is not applicable"
 fi
 # Report results. If no failures output in l_output2, we pass
[ -n "$l_pkgoutput" ] && echo -e "\n$l_pkgoutput"
 if [ -z "$l_output2" ]; then
 echo -e "\n- Audit Result:\n ** PASS **\n$l_output\n"
 else
 echo -e "\n- Audit Result:\n ** FAIL **\n - Reason(s) for audit
failure:\n$l_output2\n"
 [ -n "$l_output" ] && echo -e "\n- Correctly set:\n$l_output\n"
 fi
}
```

Run the following command to update the system databases:
```bash
# dconf update
```

Note: Users must log out and back in again before the system-wide settings take effect.
