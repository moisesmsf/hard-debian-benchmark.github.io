## Audit
IF chrony is in use on the system, run the following command to display the server and/or pool directive:
```bash
# grep -Pr --include=*.{sources,conf} '^\h*(server|pool)\h+\H+' /etc/chrony/
```

Verify that at least one pool line and/or at least three server lines are returned, and the timeserver on the returned lines follows local site policy.

Output examples:

pool directive:
```bash
pool time.nist.gov iburst maxsources 4 #The maxsources option is unique to the pool directive
```

server directive:
```bash
server time-a-g.nist.gov iburst
server 132.163.97.3 iburst
server time-d-b.nist.gov iburst
```

## Remediation
Edit /etc/chrony/chrony.conf or a file ending in .sources in /etc/chrony/sources.d/ and add or edit server or pool lines as appropriate according to local site policy:
```bash
<[server|pool]> <[remote-server|remote-pool]>
```

Examples:

pool directive:
```bash
pool time.nist.gov iburst maxsources 4 #The maxsources option is unique to the pool directive
```

server directive:
```bash
server time-a-g.nist.gov iburst
server 132.163.97.3 iburst
server time-d-b.nist.gov iburst
```

Run one of the following commands to load the updated time sources into chronyd running config:
```bash
# systemctl restart chronyd
```

OR if sources are in a .sources file

```bash
# chronyc reload sources
```

OR

If another time synchronization service is in use on the system, run the following command to remove chrony from the system:
```bash
# apt purge chrony
```
