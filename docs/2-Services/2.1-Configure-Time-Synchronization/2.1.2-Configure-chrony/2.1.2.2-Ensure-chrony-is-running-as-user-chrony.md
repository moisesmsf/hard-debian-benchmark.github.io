## Audit
IF chrony is in use on the system, run the following command to verify the chronyd service is being run as the _chrony user:
```bash
# ps -ef | awk '(/[c]hronyd/ && $1!="_chrony") { print $1 }'
```

Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Add or edit the user line to /etc/chrony/chrony.conf or a file ending in .conf in /etc/chrony/conf.d/:
```bash
user _chrony
```

OR

If another time synchronization service is in use on the system, run the following command to remove chrony from the system:
```bash
# apt purge chrony
```

Default Value:

user _chrony
