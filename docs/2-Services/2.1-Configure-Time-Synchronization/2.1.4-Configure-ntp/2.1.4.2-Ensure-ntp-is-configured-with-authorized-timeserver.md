title: 2.1.4.2 Ensure ntp is configured with authorized timeserver
description: The various modes are determined by the command keyword and the type of the required IP address. Addresses are classed by type as (s) a remote server or peer (IPv4 class A, B and C), (b) the broadcast address of a local interface, (m) a multicast address (IPv4 class D), or (r) a reference clock address (127.127.x.x).

## Audit
IF ntp is in use on the system, run the following command to display the server and/or pool mode:
```bash
# grep -P -- '^\h*(server|pool)\h+\H+' /etc/ntp.conf
```

Verify that at least one pool line and/or at least three server lines are returned, and the timeserver on the returned lines follows local site policy.

Output examples:

pool mode:
```bash
pool time.nist.gov iburst maxsources 4 #The maxsources option is unique to the pool directive
```

server mode:
```bash
server time-a-g.nist.gov iburst
server 132.163.97.3 iburst
server time-d-b.nist.gov iburst
```

## Remediation
Edit /etc/ntp.conf and add or edit server or pool lines as appropriate according to local site policy:
```bash
<[server|pool]> <[remote-server|remote-pool]>
```

Examples:

pool mode:
```bash
pool time.nist.gov iburst
```

server mode:
```bash
server time-a-g.nist.gov iburst
server 132.163.97.3 iburst
server time-d-b.nist.gov iburst
```

Run the following command to load the updated time sources into ntp running config:
```bash
# systemctl restart ntp
```

OR

If another time synchronization service is in use on the system, run the following command to remove ntp from the system:
```bash
# apt purge ntp
```
