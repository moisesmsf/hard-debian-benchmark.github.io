## Audit
IF ntp is in use on the system run the following command to verify the ntpd daemon is being run as the user ntp:
```bash
# ps -ef | awk '(/[n]tpd/ && $1!="ntp") { print $1 }'
```

Nothing should be returned

Run the following command to verify the RUNASUSER= is set to ntp in /etc/init.d/ntp:
```bash
# grep -P -- '^\h*RUNASUSER=' /etc/init.d/ntp
RUNASUSER=ntp
```

## Remediation
Add or edit the following line in /etc/init.d/ntp:
```bash
RUNASUSER=ntp
```

Run the following command to restart ntp.servocee:
```bash
# systemctl restart ntp.service
```

OR

If another time synchronization service is in use on the system, run the following command to remove ntp from the system:
```bash
# apt purge ntp
```

Default Value:

user ntp
