title: 2.2.11 Ensure Samba is not installed
description: The Samba daemon allows system administrators to configure their Linux systems to share file systems and directories with Windows desktops. Samba will advertise the file systems and directories via the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. Windows desktop users will be able to mount these directories and file systems as letter drives on their systems.
