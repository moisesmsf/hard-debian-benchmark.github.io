title: 2.2.15 Ensure mail transfer agent is configured for local-only mode
description: Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for incoming mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the system is not intended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process local mail.

## Audit
Run the following command to verify that the MTA is not listening on any non-loopback address (127.0.0.1 or::1).
```bash
# ss -lntu | grep -E ':25\s' | grep -E -v '\s(127.0.0.1|::1):25\s'
```

Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and add the following line to the RECEIVING MAIL section.

If the line already exists, change it to look like the line below:
```bash
inet_interfaces = loopback-only
```

Run the following command to restart postfix:
```bash
# systemctl restart postfix
```
