title: 2.4 Ensure nonessential services are removed or masked
description: A network port is identified by its number, the associated IP address, and the type of the communication protocol such as TCP or UDP. A listening port is a network port on which an application or process listens on, acting as a communication endpoint. Each listening port can be open or closed (filtered) using a firewall. In general terms, an open port is a network port that accepts incoming packets from remote locations.

## Audit
Run the following command:
```bash
# ss -plntu
```

Review the output to ensure that all services listed are required on the system. If a listed service is not required, remove the package containing the service. If the package containing the service is required, stop and mask the service.

## Remediation
Run the following command to remove the package containing the service:
```bash
# apt purge <package_name>
```

OR If required packages have a dependency:

Run the following commands to stop and mask the service:
```bash
# systemctl stop <service_name>.socket
# systemctl stop <service_name>.service
# systemctl mask <service_name>.socket
# systemctl mask <service_name>.service
```
