## Audit
Run the following commands and verify output includes the listed rules in order:
```bash
# ufw status verbose
To 			Action		From
-- 			------ 		----
Anywhere on lo 		ALLOW IN 	Anywhere
Anywhere 		DENY IN 	127.0.0.0/8
Anywhere (v6) on lo 	ALLOW IN 	Anywhere (v6)
Anywhere (v6) 		DENY IN 	::1
Anywhere 		ALLOW OUT 	Anywhere on lo
Anywhere (v6) 		ALLOW OUT 	Anywhere (v6) on lo
```

## Remediation
Run the following commands to implement the loopback rules:
```bash
# ufw allow in on lo
# ufw allow out on lo
# ufw deny in from 127.0.0.0/8
# ufw deny in from ::1
```
