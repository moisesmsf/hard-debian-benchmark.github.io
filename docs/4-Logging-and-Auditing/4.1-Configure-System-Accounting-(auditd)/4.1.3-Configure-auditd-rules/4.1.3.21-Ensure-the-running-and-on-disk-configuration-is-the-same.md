## Audit
**Merged rule sets**

Ensure that all rules in /etc/audit/rules.d have been merged into /etc/audit/audit.rules:
```bash
# augenrules --check
/usr/sbin/augenrules: No change
```

Should there be any drift, run augenrules --load to merge and load all rules.

## Remediation
If the rules are not aligned across all three () areas, run the following command to
merge and load all rules:
```bash
# augenrules --load
```

Check if reboot is required.
```bash
if [[ $(auditctl -s | grep "enabled") =~ "2" ]]; then echo "Reboot required to load rules"; fi
```
