## Audit
Run the following command to verify the audit tools have mode 755 or more restrictive, are owned by the root user and group root:
```bash
# stat -c "%n %U" /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace /sbin/auditd /sbin/augenrules | grep -Pv -- '^\h*\H+\h+root\h*$'
```

Nothing should be returned

## Remediation
Run the following command to change the owner of the audit tools to the root user:
```bash
# chown root /sbin/auditctl /sbin/aureport /sbin/ausearch /sbin/autrace /sbin/auditd /sbin/augenrules
```
