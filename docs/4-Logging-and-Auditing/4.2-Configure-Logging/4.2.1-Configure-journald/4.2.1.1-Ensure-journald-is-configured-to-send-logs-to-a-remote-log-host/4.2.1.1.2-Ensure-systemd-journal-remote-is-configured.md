## Audit
Verify systemd-journal-remote is configured.

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -P "^ *URL=|^ *ServerKeyFile=|^ *ServerCertificateFile=|^ *TrustedCertificateFile=" /etc/systemd/journal-upload.conf
```

Verify the output matches per your environments certificate locations and the URL of the log server. Example:
```bash
URL=192.168.50.42
ServerKeyFile=/etc/ssl/private/journal-upload.pem
ServerCertificateFile=/etc/ssl/certs/journal-upload.pem
TrustedCertificateFile=/etc/ssl/ca/trusted.pem
```

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/systemd/journal-upload.conf file and ensure the following lines are set per your environment:
```bash
URL=192.168.50.42
ServerKeyFile=/etc/ssl/private/journal-upload.pem
ServerCertificateFile=/etc/ssl/certs/journal-upload.pem
TrustedCertificateFile=/etc/ssl/ca/trusted.pem
```

Restart the service:
```bash
# systemctl restart systemd-journal-upload
```
