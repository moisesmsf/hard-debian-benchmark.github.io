## Audit
Run the following command to verify systemd-journald is enabled:
```bash
# systemctl is-enabled systemd-journald.service
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
static
```

## Remediation
By default the systemd-journald service does not have an [Install] section and thus
cannot be enabled / disabled. It is meant to be referenced as Requires or Wants by other unit files. As such, if the status of systemd-journald is not static, investigate why.
