## Audit
Review /etc/systemd/journald.conf and verify that large files will be compressed:
```bash
# grep ^\s*Compress /etc/systemd/journald.conf
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
Compress=yes
```

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file and add the following line:
```bash
Compress=yes
```

Restart the service:
```bash
# systemctl restart systemd-journald
```
