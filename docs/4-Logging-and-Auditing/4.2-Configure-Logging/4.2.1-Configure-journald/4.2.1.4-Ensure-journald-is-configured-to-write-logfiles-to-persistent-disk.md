## Audit
Review /etc/systemd/journald.conf and verify that logs are persisted to disk:
```bash
# grep ^\s*Storage /etc/systemd/journald.conf
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
Storage=persistent
```

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file and add the following line:
```bash
Storage=persistent
```

Restart the service:
```bash
# systemctl restart systemd-journald
```
