## Audit
**IF** journald is the method for capturing logs

Review /etc/systemd/journald.conf and verify that logs are not forwarded to rsyslog.
```bash
# grep ^\s*ForwardToSyslog /etc/systemd/journald.conf
```

Verify that there is no output.

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file and ensure that ForwardToSyslog=yes is removed.

Restart the service:
```bash
# systemctl restart systemd-journald
```
