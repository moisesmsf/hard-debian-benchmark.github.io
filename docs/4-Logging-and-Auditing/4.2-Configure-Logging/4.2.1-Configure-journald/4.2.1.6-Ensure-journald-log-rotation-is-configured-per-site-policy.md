## Audit
Review /etc/systemd/journald.conf and verify logs are rotated according to site policy. The specific parameters for log rotation are:
```bash
SystemMaxUse=
SystemKeepFree=
RuntimeMaxUse=
RuntimeKeepFree=
MaxFileSec=
```

## Remediation
Review /etc/systemd/journald.conf and verify logs are rotated according to site policy. The settings should be carefully understood as there are specific edge cases
and prioritisation of parameters.

The specific parameters for log rotation are:
```bash
SystemMaxUse=
SystemKeepFree=
RuntimeMaxUse=
RuntimeKeepFree=
MaxFileSec=
```
