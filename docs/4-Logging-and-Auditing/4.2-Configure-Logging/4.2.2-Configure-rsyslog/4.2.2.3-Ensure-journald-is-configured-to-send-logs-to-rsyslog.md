## Audit
IF RSyslog is the preferred method for capturing logs

Review /etc/systemd/journald.conf and verify that logs are forwarded to rsyslog.
```bash
# grep ^\s*ForwardToSyslog /etc/systemd/journald.conf
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
ForwardToSyslog=yes
```

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file and add the following line:
```bash
ForwardToSyslog=yes
```

Restart the service:
```bash
# systemctl restart rsyslog
```
