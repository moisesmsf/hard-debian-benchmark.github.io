## Audit
Run the following command:
```bash
# grep ^\$FileCreateMode /etc/rsyslog.conf /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
$FileCreateMode 0640
```
Should a site policy dictate less restrictive permissions, ensure to follow said policy.

**NOTE**: More restrictive permissions such as 0600 is implicitly sufficient.
## Remediation
Edit either /etc/rsyslog.conf or a dedicated .conf file in /etc/rsyslog.d/ and set $FileCreateMode to 0640 or more restrictive:
```bash
$FileCreateMode 0640
```

Restart the service:
```bash
# systemctl restart rsyslog
```
