## Audit
Review the contents of /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf files to ensure appropriate logging is set. In addition, run the following command and verify that the log files are logging information as expected:
```bash
# ls -l /var/log/
```

## Remediation
Edit the following lines in the /etc/rsyslog.conf and /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf files as appropriate for your environment.

NOTE: The below configuration is shown for example purposes only. Due care should be given to how the organization wish to store log data.
```bash
*.emerg :omusrmsg:*
auth,authpriv.* /var/log/secure
mail.* -/var/log/mail
mail.info -/var/log/mail.info
mail.warning -/var/log/mail.warn
mail.err /var/log/mail.err
cron.* /var/log/cron
*.=warning;*.=err -/var/log/warn
*.crit /var/log/warn
*.*;mail.none;news.none -/var/log/messages
local0,local1.* -/var/log/localmessages
local2,local3.* -/var/log/localmessages
local4,local5.* -/var/log/localmessages
local6,local7.* -/var/log/localmessages
```

Run the following command to reload the rsyslogd configuration:
```bash
# systemctl restart rsyslog
```
