## Audit
Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access does not grant permissions to group or other:
```bash
# stat /etc/crontab
Access: (0600/-rw-------) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
```

## Remediation
Run the following commands to set ownership and permissions on /etc/crontab:
```bash
# chown root:root /etc/crontab
# chmod og-rwx /etc/crontab
```
