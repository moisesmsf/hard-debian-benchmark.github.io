## Audit
Run the following command and verify Uid and Gid are both 0/root and Access does not grant permissions to group or other:
```bash
# stat /etc/cron.d/
Access: (0700/drwx------) Uid: ( 0/ root) Gid: ( 0/ root)
```

## Remediation
Remediation:
Run the following commands to set ownership and permissions on the /etc/cron.d directory:
```bash
# chown root:root /etc/cron.d/
# chmod og-rwx /etc/cron.d/
```
