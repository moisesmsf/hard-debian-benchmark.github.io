## Audit
Run the following command:
```bash
# sshd -T -C user=root -C host="$(hostname)" -C addr="$(grep $(hostname) /etc/hosts | awk '{print $1}')" | grep -i x11forwarding
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
x11forwarding no
```

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -Ei '^\s*x11forwarding\s+yes' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Nothing is returned.

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
```bash
X11Forwarding no
```
