## Audit
Run the following command and verify that output MaxAuthTries is 4 or less:
```bash
# sshd -T -C user=root -C host="$(hostname)" -C addr="$(grep $(hostname) /etc/hosts | awk '{print $1}')" | grep maxauthtries
maxauthtries 4
```

Run the following command and verify that the output:
```bash
# grep -Ei '^\s*maxauthtries\s+([5-9]|[1-9][0-9]+)' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Nothing is returned

## Remediation
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows:
```bash
MaxAuthTries 4
```

**Default Value:**

MaxAuthTries 6
