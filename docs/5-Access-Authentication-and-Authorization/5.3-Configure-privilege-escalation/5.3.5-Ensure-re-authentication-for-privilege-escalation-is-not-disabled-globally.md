## Audit
Verify the operating system requires users to re-authenticate for privilege escalation.

Check the configuration of the /etc/sudoers and /etc/sudoers.d/* files with the following command:
```bash
# grep -r "^[^#].*\!authenticate" /etc/sudoers*
```

If any line is found with a !authenticate tag, refer to the remediation procedure below.

## Remediation
Configure the operating system to require users to reauthenticate for privilege escalation.

Based on the outcome of the audit procedure, use visudo -f ``<PATH TO FILE>`` to edit the relevant sudoers file.

Remove any occurrences of !authenticate tags in the file(s).
