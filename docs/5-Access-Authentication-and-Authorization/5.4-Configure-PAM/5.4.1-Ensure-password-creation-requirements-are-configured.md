## Audit
Verify password creation requirements conform to organization policy.

**Password length**

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep '^\s*minlen\s*' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
minlen = 14
```

**Password complexity**

**Option 1**

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep '^\s*minclass\s*' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
minclass = 4
```

**Option 2** 

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -E '^\s*[duol]credit\s*' /etc/security/pwquality.conf
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
lcredit = -1
ocredit = -1
```

## Remediation
The following setting is a recommend example policy. Alter these values to conform to your own organization's password policies.

Run the following command to install the pam_pwquality module:
```bash
# apt install libpam-pwquality
```

Edit the file /etc/security/pwquality.conf and add or modify the following line for password length to conform to site policy:
```bash
minlen = 14
```

Edit the file /etc/security/pwquality.conf and add or modify the following line for password complexity to conform to site policy:

**Option 1**
```bash
minclass = 4
```

**Option 2**

```bash
dcredit = -1
ucredit = -1
ocredit = -1
lcredit = -1
```
