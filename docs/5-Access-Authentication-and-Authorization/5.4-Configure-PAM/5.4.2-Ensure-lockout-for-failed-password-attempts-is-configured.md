## Audit
Verify password lockouts are configured. These settings are commonly configured with the pam_faillock.so module found in /etc/pam.d/common-auth and /etc/pam.d/common-account.

**Common auth**

Run the following command to verify pam_faillock.so is configured in /etc/pam.d/common-auth:
```bash
# grep "pam_faillock.so" /etc/pam.d/common-auth
```

Verify the output includes the three pam_faillock.so lines:
```bash
auth required pam_faillock.so preauth
auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail
auth sufficient pam_faillock.so authsucc
```

**Common account**

Run the following command to verify pam_faillock.so is configured in /etc/pam.d/common-account:
```bash
# grep "pam_faillock.so" /etc/pam.d/common-account
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
account required pam_faillock.so
```

**Fail lock configuration**

Run the following command to verify deny, fail_interval, and unlock time are configured in /etc/security/faillock.conf:
```bash
awk '/^ *deny *=/\
||/^ *fail_interval *=/\
||/^ *unlock_time *=/' /etc/security/faillock.conf
```

Verify the output:

* deny is not greater than 4
* fail_interval is no greater than 900
* unlock_time is 0, or greater than or equal to 600
* Settings follow local site policy

Example:
```bash
deny = 4
fail_interval = 900
unlock time = 600
```

## Remediation
**NOTE**: Pay special attention to the configuration. Incorrect configuration can cause system lock outs. This is example configuration. You configuration may differ based on previous changes to the files.

**Common auth**

Edit /etc/pam.d/common-auth and ensure that faillock is configured.

**Note**: It is critical to understand each line and the relevant arguments for successful implementation. The order of these entries is very specific. The pam_faillock.so lines surround the pam_unix.so line. The comment "Added to enable faillock" is shown to highlight the additional lines and their order in the file.
```bash
# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
auth required pam_faillock.so preauth # Added to enable faillock
auth [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so nullok
auth [default=die] pam_faillock.so authfail # Added to enable faillock
auth sufficient pam_faillock.so authsucc # Added to enable faillock
# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
auth requisite pam_deny.so
# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
auth required pam_permit.so
# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
auth optional pam_cap.so
# end of pam-auth-update config
```

**Common account**

Edit /etc/pam.d/common-account and ensure that the following stanza is at the end of the file.
```bash
account required pam_faillock.so
```

**Fail lock configuration**

Edit /etc/security/faillock.conf and configure it per your site policy.

Example:
```bash
deny = 4
fail_interval = 900
unlock time = 600
```
