## Audit
**PAM**

No hashing algorithm should be configured in /etc/pam.d/common-password.

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -v ^# /etc/pam.d/common-password | grep -E "(yescrypt|md5|bigcrypt|sha256|sha512|blowfish)"
```

Verify that there is no output.

If there is a business requirement to configure the hashing algorithm in PAM, ensure that the same algorithm is configured in /etc/login.defs.

**Login definitions**

Run the following command:
```bash
# grep -i "^\s*ENCRYPT_METHOD\s*yescrypt\s*$" /etc/login.defs
```

Verify the output matches:
```bash
ENCRYPT_METHOD yescrypt
```

## Remediation
**NOTE**: Pay special attention to the configuration. Incorrect configuration can cause system lock outs. This is example configuration. You configuration may differ based on previous changes to the files.

**PAM**

Edit the /etc/pam.d/common-password file and ensure that no hashing algorithm option for pam_unix.so is set:
```bash
password [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so obscure use_authtok try_first_pass remember=5
```

**Login definitions**

Edit /etc/login.defs and ensure that ENCRYPT_METHOD is set to yescrypt
