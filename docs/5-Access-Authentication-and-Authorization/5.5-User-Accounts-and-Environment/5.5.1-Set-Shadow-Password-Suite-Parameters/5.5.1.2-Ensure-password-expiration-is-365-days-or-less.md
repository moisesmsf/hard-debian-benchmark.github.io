## Audit
Run the following command and verify PASS_MAX_DAYS conforms to site policy, does not exceed 365 days, and is greater than PASS_MIN_DAYS:
```bash
# grep PASS_MAX_DAYS /etc/login.defs
PASS_MAX_DAYS 365
```

Run the following command and Review list of users and PASS_MAX_DAYS to verify that all users' PASS_MAX_DAYS conforms to site policy, does not exceed 365 days, and is no less than PASS_MIN_DAYS
```bash
# awk -F: '(/^[^:]+:[^!*]/ && ($5>365 || $5~/([0-1]|-1|\s*)/)){print $1 " " $5}' /etc/shadow
No <user>:<PASS_MAX_DAYS> should be returned
```

## Remediation
Set the PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter to conform to site policy in /etc/login.defs :
```bash
PASS_MA_DAYS 365
```

Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:
```bash
# chage --maxdays 365 <user>
```

**Default Value**:

PASS_MAX_DAYS 99999
