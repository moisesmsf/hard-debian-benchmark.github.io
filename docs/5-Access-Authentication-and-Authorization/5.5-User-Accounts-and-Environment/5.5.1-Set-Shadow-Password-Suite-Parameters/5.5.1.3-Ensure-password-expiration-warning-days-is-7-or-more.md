## Audit
Run the following command and verify PASS_WARN_AGE conforms to site policy (No less than 7 days):
```bash
# grep PASS_WARN_AGE /etc/login.defs
PASS_WARN_AGE 7
```

Verify all users with a password have their number of days of warning before password expires set to 7 or more:

Run the following command and Review list of users and PASS_WARN_AGE to verify that all users' PASS_WARN_AGE conforms to site policy (No less than 7 days):
```bash
# awk -F: '(/^[^:]+:[^!*]/ && $6<7){print $1 " " $6}' /etc/shadow
No <user>:<PASS_WARN_AGE> should be returned
```

## Remediation
Set the PASS_WARN_AGE parameter to 7 in /etc/login.defs :
```bash
PASS_WARN_AGE 7
```

Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match:
```bash
# chage --warndays 7 <user>
```

**Default Value**:

PASS_WARN_AGE 7
