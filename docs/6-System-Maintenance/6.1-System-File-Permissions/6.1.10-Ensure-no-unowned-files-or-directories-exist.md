## Audit
Run the following command and verify no files are returned:
```bash
# df --local -P | awk {'if (NR!=1) print $6'} | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -nouser
```

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items on network mounted partitions. Additionally the --local option to df is not universal to all versions, it can be omitted to search all filesystems on a system including network mounted filesystems or the following command can be run manually for each partition:
```bash
# find <partition> -xdev -nouser
```

## Remediation
Locate files that are owned by users or groups not listed in the system configuration files, and reset the ownership of these files to some active user on the system as appropriate.
