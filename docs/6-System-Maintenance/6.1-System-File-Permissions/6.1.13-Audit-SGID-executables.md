## Audit
Run the following command to list SGID files:
```bash
# df --local -P | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $6}' | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f -perm -2000
```

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items on network mounted partitions. Additionally the --local option to df is not universal to all versions, it can be omitted to search all filesystems on a system including network mounted filesystems or the following command can be run manually for each partition:
```bash
# find <partition> -xdev -type f -perm -2000
```

## Remediation
Ensure that no rogue SGID programs have been introduced into the system. Review the files returned by the action in the Audit section and confirm the integrity of these binaries.
