## Audit
Run the following command to verify /etc/shadow- is mode 640 or more restrictive, Uid is 0/root and Gid is 0/root:
```bash
# stat -Lc "%n %a %u/%U %g/%G" /etc/shadow-
```

Example:
```bash
/etc/shadow 640 0/root 42/shadow-
```

## Remediation
Run one of the following commands to set ownership of /etc/shadow- to root and group to either root or shadow:
```bash
# chown root:shadow /etc/shadow-
```

-OR-
```bash
# chown root:root /etc/shadow-
```

Run the following command to remove excess permissions form /etc/shadow-:
```bash
# chmod u-x,g-wx,o-rwx /etc/shadow-
```

**Default Value**:

/etc/shadow- 640 0/root 42/shadow
