## Audit
Run the following command and verify no files are returned:
```bash
# df --local -P | awk '{if (NR!=1) print $6}' | xargs -I '{}' find '{}' -xdev -type f -perm -0002
```

The command above only searches local filesystems, there may still be compromised items on network mounted partitions. Additionally the --local option to df is not universal to all versions, it can be omitted to search all filesystems on a system including network mounted filesystems or the following command can be run manually for each partition:
```bash
# find <partition> -xdev -type f -perm -0002
```

## Remediation
Removing write access for the "other" category ( ``chmod o-w <filename>`` ) is advisable, but always consult relevant vendor documentation to avoid breaking any application dependencies on a given file.
