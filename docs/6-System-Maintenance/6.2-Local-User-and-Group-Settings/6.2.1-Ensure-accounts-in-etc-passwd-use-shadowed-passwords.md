## Audit
Run the following command and verify that no output is returned:
```bash
# awk -F: '($2 != "x" ) { print $1 " is not set to shadowed passwords "}' /etc/passwd
```

## Remediation
Run the following command to set accounts to use shadowed passwords:
```bash
# sed -e 's/^\([a-zA-Z0-9_]*\):[^:]*:/\1:x:/' -i /etc/passwd
```

Investigate to determine if the account is logged in and what it is being used for, to determine if it needs to be forced off.
