## Audit
Run the following script to verify local interactive users own their home directories:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash

{
 output=""
 valid_shells="^($( sed -rn '/^\//{s,/,\\\\/,g;p}' /etc/shells | paste -s -d '|' - ))$"
 awk -v pat="$valid_shells" -F: '$(NF) ~ pat { print $1 " " $(NF-1) }' /etc/passwd | (while read -r user home; do
 owner="$(stat -L -c "%U" "$home")"
 [ "$owner" != "$user" ] && output="$output\n - User \"$user\" home directory \"$home\" is owned by user \"$owner\""
 done
 if [ -z "$output" ]; then
 echo -e "\n-PASSED: - All local interactive users have a home directory\n"
 else
 echo -e "\n- FAILED:\n$output\n"
 fi
 )
}
```

## Remediation
Change the ownership of any home directories that are not owned by the defined user to the correct user.

The following script will update local interactive user home directories to be own by the user:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env bash

{
 output=""
 valid_shells="^($( sed -rn '/^\//{s,/,\\\\/,g;p}' /etc/shells | paste -s -d '|' - ))$"
 awk -v pat="$valid_shells" -F: '$(NF) ~ pat { print $1 " " $(NF-1) }' /etc/passwd | while read -r user home; do
 owner="$(stat -L -c "%U" "$home")"
 if [ "$owner" != "$user" ]; then
 echo -e "\n- User \"$user\" home directory \"$home\" is owned by user \"$owner\"\n - changing ownership to \"$user\"\n"
 chown "$user" "$home"
 fi
 done
}
```
