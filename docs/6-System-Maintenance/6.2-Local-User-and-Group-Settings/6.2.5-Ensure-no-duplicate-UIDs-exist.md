## Audit
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/bin/bash

cut -f3 -d":" /etc/passwd | sort -n | uniq -c | while read x ; do
 [ -z "$x" ] && break
 set - $x
 if [ $1 -gt 1 ]; then
 users=$(awk -F: '($3 == n) { print $1 }' n=$2 /etc/passwd | xargs)
 echo "Duplicate UID ($2): $users"
 fi
done
```

## Remediation
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique UIDs and review all files owned by the shared UIDs to determine which UID they are supposed to belong to.
