## Audit
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/bin/bash
cut -d: -f3 /etc/group | sort | uniq -d | while read x ; do
 echo "Duplicate GID ($x) in /etc/group"
done
```

## Remediation
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique GIDs and review all files owned by the shared GID to determine which group they are supposed to belong to.
