## Audit
Run the following script and verify no results are returned:
```bash linenums="1"
#!/bin/bash

cut -d: -f1 /etc/group | sort | uniq -d | while read -r x; do
 echo "Duplicate group name $x in /etc/group"
done
```

## Remediation
Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique names for the user groups. File group ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as the groups have unique GIDs.
