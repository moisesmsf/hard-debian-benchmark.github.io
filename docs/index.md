# Hardening + Debian + CIS Benchmarks

This project simplifies the application of the [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks) for the [Debian Linux OS](https://www.debian.org/).

In short, it brings the **Audit** and **Recommendation** sections of all security settings contained in the latest version to the most recent release of Debian Linux available in the [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks).

In [Tags](/tags) it is possible to find the recommended security configurations based on several aspects, such as the mapping between a recommendation and the [CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls)](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls) version, Safeguard and Implementation Group (IG) and the mapping between a recommendation and the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) tactics, techniques, and mitigations.
